## Pull to the Host and Side-Load
kind can load an image from the host with the kind [load ... commands](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#loading-an-image-into-your-cluster). If you configure your host with credentials to pull the desired image(s) and then load them to the nodes you can avoid needing to authenticate on the nodes.
